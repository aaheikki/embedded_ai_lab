### Who is this for?
- Students and researchers in embedded systems, AI and robotics
- Small companies or startups exploring embedded AI solutions
- Hobbyists interested in automation, robotics and AI

### Core Principles 
- **Open and Replicable**: All designs and workflows are documented to allow others to replicate the lab or individual pilot projects and build on top of them.
- **Educational Focus**: Documentation will contain educational material to help users learn ideas and concepts in embedded AI with hands on examples.
- **Research to product**: The lab focuses on turning research concepts into practical, deployable embedded AI solutions.


### Project Timeline / Roadmap
The Embedded AI Laboratory Project at the Kuopio campus of the University of Eastern Finland runs from 1.1.2026 to 31.7.2028.

The Projects main goals are:
- developing an open-access embedded AI software platform,
- producing documentation and educational recourses and
- demonstrating embedded AI with multiple pilot projects
