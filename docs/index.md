The Embedded AI Laboratory Project at the Kuopio campus of **the University of Eastern Finland** focuses on the development and implementation of embedded AI technologies. The laboratory's goals are to develop an open-access embedded ai software platform, including instructions and educational material to support learning and replication. The platform is demonstrated through multiple pilot projects.

### Who is this for?
- Students and researchers in AI and embedded systems
- Small companies or startups looking into embedded AI solutions
- Hobbyist interested in automation, robotics and AI

### Core Principles 
- **Open and Replicable**: All designs and workflows are documented to allow others to replicate the lab or individual pilots and build on top of them.
- **Educational Focus**: Documentation will contain educational material to help users learn ideas and concepts in embedded AI with hands on examples.
- **Research towards product**: Embedded AI bridges the gap between research and development towards working product.
