The project consist of implementing and developing embedded AI laboratory at the Kuopio campus of the University of Eastern Finland and embedded AI software platform with instructions and education material open for all. The platform is demonstrated with multiple pilots consisting of:

- PCB Assembly line
- Drone swarm
- Pipeline control system
- Humanoid robot
