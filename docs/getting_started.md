## Before getting started


### What is version control and why to use it
- **Version control** is practice of tracking and controlling changes in computer files. 
- **Tracking changes** provides history of changes that can be used to go back in time if some unsolvable bugs arise later in the development.
- **Branching and Merging** lets team members to commit changes in their own environment without hindering others work and when changes are ready they can be merged to the main branch. Branching is also useful for individuals workflow in testing or developing on top of main software without need of creating copies of project folders and keeping track of them.

### Code Documentation and its benefits
- **Inline comments** are used in the code to explain partitions of code.
    - **Structure**: Writing and commenting code to form clear structure of the code makes the code easy to navigate enabling quicker debugging.
    - **Reasoning**: Explaining non obvious technical choices helps to avoid same problems in the future it was used to fix.
- **User/Project documentation** is situated outside of the software code to work as a table of content and guide for users.
    - **Building on top**: Easy to build on top when you can figure out what tools there already are in your toolshed.
    - **Collaboration**: Collaborators become quickly productive members while maintaining consistency of the project.
    - **User adoption**: User are more likely to use something easily understandable and implementable.
