The laboratory's goals are to develop an open-access embedded ai software platform, including instructions and educational material to support learning and replication. The platform is demonstrated through multiple pilot projects:</p> <ul> <li>PCB Assembly line</li> <li>Drone swarm</li> <li>Pipeline control system</li> <li>Humanoid robot</li> </ul> <p>A Strong emphasis is placed on making the project replicable. To achieve this, the construction of the laboratory is fully documented, and a workflow model for embedded AI software development and documentation is provided. </p>"}]}
