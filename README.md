The project implements and demonstrates an embedded system platform utilizing artificial intelligence. This platform can then be utilized, in particular, by the Northern Savo industry. The project will also produce instructions and education material that enables the utilization of the platform. The project increases general awareness and competence related to embedded systems utilizing AI.

The project also implements a laboratoy related to the platform at the Kuopio campus of the University of EasternFinland. This laboratory faciliates the implementation and adoption of the fast prototyping cycle for the regional enterprices.
